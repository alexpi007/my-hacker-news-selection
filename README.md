  > One of the easiest tests to determine if you are at risk is to look hard at what you do every day and see if you, yourself, could code yourself out of a job. Programming involves a lot of rote workâ€”templating, boilerplate, and the like. If you can see a way to write a system to replace yourself, either do it, do not tell your bosses, and collect your salary while reading novels in your cubicle, or look for something more challenging to work on.

  > It's not enough to know how computers work, how to use programming languages, to know algorithms and data structures, or how to use the varied tools involved in software construction.

  > Take care of yourself. Sleep. Eat. Exercise. Rest. Relax. Take care of other people, as best you can. People are important. Software is just fun.
